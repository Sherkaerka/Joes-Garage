# Welcome to Joe's Garage

Joe's Garage is a basic business website for a local garage. They provide basic car service like oil change, brakes service and wheel alignment. They also sell DIY kits to allow customers to either do service in their own garage or to rent a car lift at Joe's to do the job side by side with experienced mechanics.

The intended audience is anyone with a car, but of course the theme can easily be changed.

Live site can be visited at: [Joe's Garage website](https://sherkaerka.github.io/Joes-Garage "Joe's Garage")

### Design Choices <a name="designchoices"></a>
I wanted to create a fresh and clean site but with some classic garage feeling.

#### Typography <a name="typography"></a>

Body and headers uses different font weight and spacing of Open Sans with a fallback to sans-serif. The logo to Joe's garage that s displayed in both the header and footer is Yellowtail.

#### Color scheme <a name="colorscheme"></a>

## Features <a name="features"></a>
Joe's Garage is set up as a basic business website with some more modern touch covering the most important functions to interact with visitors.

### Home <a name="home"></a>
The home page starts out with a little bit different layout with a larger hero image in the background. This image changes on smaller screens to render more nicely as seen on the [responsive image](#welcome-to-joes-garage) further up.

#### Navigation menu <a name="navigationmenu"></a>
Navigation menu shown on every page. On large and medium screens it appears top right and om smaller screens it is moved below Joe's Garage logo. On smaller screen we also add some background color to make sure the contrast is good still with the new hero image.

The menu has hover coloring and an underscore on the actual page being visited.

#### 24 hour service number <a name="24h"></a>
Since we are presenting a garage cars do not only need service, but sometimes they break down. Therefor Joe's 24 hour service number get some extra display on the home-page. Visually it acts like the menu thus getting a background color for contrast on smaller screens. It also has some extra glow added to it to stand out, abit like a tube light.
