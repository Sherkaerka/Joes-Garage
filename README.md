**Welcome to Joe's Garage,**

Joe's Garage is a basic business website for a local garage. They provide basic car service like oil change, brakes service and wheel alignment. They also sell DIY kits to allow customers to either do service in their own garage or to rent a car lift at Joe's to do the job side by side with experienced mechanics.

The intended audience is anyone with a car, but of course the theme can easily be changed.

Live site can be visited at: **https://sherkaerka.github.io/Joes-Garage**

## Languages
